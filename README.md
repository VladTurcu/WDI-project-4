# <h3>Notes</h3>
The most challenging part of this project was TIME, and deciding which features to remove from my list in order to finish in time.
In the future I would like to add more courses and content, and would like to add email certification when user finish a course, a course admin review in that way the admin of the website can check if a course is right for this app before publishing and of course an admin area where the administrator of the website can remove, edit and publish courses added by users and same remove and edit users.
